    $description = "<p>After Warcraft I, II, III and two months on World of Warcraft, I must draw something belonging to this universe. At that moment, if I did not dare draw a female elf, I was afraid to miss her ^^. I did not want to destroy an elf beauty so I prefered to draw something else, an object for instance. So I drew the Dark Portal. It can appear to be simple but even the perspective reveals to be an obstacle to overcome. Anyway, first drawings, first problems...</p><p>Some cultural points: In the Warcraft universe, the Dark Portal a magic bond between <a href='http://www.wowwiki.com/Azeroth_(world)'>Azeroth</a>, the world of Human, Dwarves and Elves, and <a href='http://www.wowwiki.com/Draenor'>Draenor</a>, the world of the Orc and the Undead. When controlled by Sargeras, the guardian <a href='http://www.wowwiki.com/Medivh'>Medivh</a> created this portal. The gate between Azeroth and Draenor was now opened, then the Burning Legion. The First can now begin...and I can now play Warcraft I! The legend of Warcraft can now begin!!!
