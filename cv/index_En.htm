<p>Welcome on my CV miniwebsite. I am a student at <a href = "http://www.mines.inpl-nancy.fr"> the <i>Ecole des Mines de Nancy</i></a>, one of the top French engineering universities. I major in IT and the main studied language is Java. However, at the <i>Ecole des Mines de Nancy</i> our minors are very various, letting us to stand back on the others fields. Thus, in the firm term (Sept 2009-Feb 2010) my minors are management, IT in Art and History of Art since 1850. Futhermore, I studied three foreign languages: English, Chinese Mandarin(intermediate) and Japanese (beginner). I tried to learn Web development skills myself in order to be able to introduce myself on the Internet. Unfortunately, I am quite busy that is why my website is permanently under construction/update. I know that many things are still missing.</p>

<p>From August 2010 to August 2011, I was in Hong Kong for an off-cycle internship in <i><a href = "http://www.soldatagroup.com/">Soldata Asia Limited</a></i> as an IT engineer. Actually, my status was a hybrid one: Site Engineering and IT were at stake in my missions. </p>

<p> I will available for my next job in mid-March 2012. </p>
