  <p> <?php moreButton('SolData'); ?> Off-cycle internship at <a href='http://www.soldatagroup.com/'>SolData Asia Ltd</a> 
  <br /> July 2010 - July 2011 (12 months), HONG KONG </p>
  <p> I was a hybrid engineer: my missions concerned IT and site engineering at the same time, from monitoring projects to the deployment of a VMware based virtualization system. SolData Asia belongs to the <a href='http://www.vinci.com/vinci.nsf/en/index.htm'>Vinci Group</a></p>
  <?php moreDiv('SolData'); ?>
    <p>We can separate this year in three parts:
  
  <div>
  <ul>
    <li> <p>Virtualization Project: <br />
      I was asked to set up a new virtualization server. Indeed, each monitoring project required a calculation server. Due to monitoring projects size in Hong Kong, a single desktop was enough. However, we needed a desktop each time we have a new project. Thus, migrating to a virtualization will improve It management, makes monitoring projects deployment easier and faster and everything will be centralized. <br />
    I was charged of this project from the very beginning to the end. The very beginning was an analysis: what was SolData Asia requirements? Then I had to meet these requirements. I finally chose a Dell hardware configuration coupled with a <a href='http://www.vmware.com/solutions/smb/index.html'>VMware vSphere Essential</a>. At the same time, I had to subscribe to related services: proper broadband, email-to-sms conversion service and 3G USB dongles.<br />
    After accouting checkings, I had to organize deliveries (more or less at the same time) and then mount the server. After mounting and connecting the hardware and all the redundancies, I had to do basic set up for the firmwares (EqualLogic disk array, network switch). I can now install OS (VMware ESXi 4.1, Windows Server 2008 R2) and VMware. Afterwards, the backup (disk back up and tape back up) had to be configured. I can also configure our own firewall and set up a VPN to manage external access to the system.<br />
    The lasted (and longest) part was handover. I had to do a tidy configuration so that if someone has a look on it, he can easily understand my configuration. I also wrote some handover files (how-to documents for instance).</p>
    </li>
    
    <li> <p>Monitoring Project :<br />
      This involves both IT and site engineering. Before the virtualization system, we had to deploy a whole calculation server. We actually get a desktop. After installing the OS and basic software, we have to install SolData software. The next step is configuration. According to the client expectation, we set up some configuration and need to test it. This also implies a cross-over with the site configuration. I had to be on site to install the theodolites (a measuring instrument) and check the prisms installation. <br />
    I was on a MTR project. <a href='http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/homepage/cust_index.html'>MTR</a> is the railway company in Hong Kong. We had to add a specific reporting tool developed in VBA (Reports were in Excel Format).</p>
    </li>
    
    <li> <p>Development Project:<br />
     Micron II is the next SolData wireless datalogger. However, the current interface was not suitable for a site deployment. Thus, I had to do a basis for the interface software. This project was coded in Qt, a C++ framework. I had to focus on low level layer (communication with the datalogger and Application, ie the protocol itself). All interface-related would be subcontracted later. However, I couldn't help do some interfaces. I did a basis one to show how my software works. <br />
     For my handover, I provided class diagram, use case diagram and a Doxygen documentation.</p></li>

    <p>Everymetallic bars which underwent spraying got some copper mark. My job consisted in cleaning these bars up to get rid of those marks. Then I had to put them into boxes and move the boxes if necessary. I was sometimes assigned to some "factory upkeep" tasks.</p>

    <p> As I am officially retired, I can keep doing my trainer task. With more experience, I have a different point of view on the organisation and the structure of Anim'Est. However, I was not allowed to interfere in the new council's decisions. Moreover, for Anim'Est 2010, Anim'Est will change it status, becoming a real voluntary association (an association under the French law, a law voted in 1901). Then, Anim'est can get more visibility.

    <p> As far as I am concerned, I think Treasurer allowed me to have an overall point of view on Anim'Est. Of course, president would have been a better position. However, I prefered to focus on a specific task: communication. During the preparation year, my treasurer duty was not so important so that I can allocate some time to internal communication (within my own school with other students and the administration) and interschool communication (how to exchange information and to confront opinions between two different schools). Due to the lack of staff within my school, I also had the recruitment responsability. Consequently, I also did the training for the newly coming staff. After the 2009 edition, I kept doing my trainer job, from advising to an overview from a great distance.</p>

    <p> The Junior Enterprise may be the most professional association within an Engineering university. The idea is simple: some company have some requirements which can be met by the <i>Ecole des Mines</i> students. Our job consist is join both of them. We act like an intermediate between the client (a company) and the service provider (a student). However, my job consisted in internal communication rather than external communication. Thus, as internal communication involves contact with students and administration, I was also in charge of the event organization. Most of our event should have a professional impact (meeting between companies and students, lecture, workshop...) </p>

      <?php moreDiv('Dessin'); ?>
      <p> I didn't enjoy Drawing before. But by drawing more and more, I realized that I really love it. I only draw with pencils for the moment but I will try different art: chinese ink, graphic tablets, video are some projects. I learnt a lot by drawing: patience and passion for instance. Moreover, I have learnt a lot on myself by paying attention on my drawing style. The way I do the stroke, the way I do the shading and the way I do the lineart are the details which can unveil some aspects of my personality. Drawing exercises can also be consider, in some way, as mental exercises. Indeed, to my mind, drawing is not only a matter of skills or pencils, it also involves our mental, our point of view on ourself.</p>

  <li> <?php moreButton('Ecriture'); ?> Writing
    <?php moreDiv('Ecriture'); ?>
      <p> I only write in French because I don't consider that my English is good enough to sustain my writing skills in English. As I only write in French, I won't develop too much on writing (see my CV in French). What I like the most in writing is to play with words, to discover their real meaning when you combine it when other words. By playing on the meaning, the pronunciation and the shape, writing may reach a form of beauty which can equals a very good pencil drawing. However, this beauty belongs to another style which is very interesting to discover. I may say that drawing is showing whereas writing is explaining. </p>
