 "<p> This is the Night Elf cover of the World of Warcraft game box. This is the first time I really draw a face since I got my small zap book. An elf face is a little bit different from human face from the proportion point of view. Thus, if I am wrong on some details, it could be OK for this ^^. </p>
<p> Moreover, this is the first I did some scaling. By scaling I mean measure the eyes size or how long the smile is. I actually compared the size with common object. For instance, I had a look whether the eyes is 3-pencil-width long or half-thumb long. The action is quite funny to see: I completely look like an idiot to do so! At that time, I did a 1:1 scaling. It is only the beginning of a long era. I only do a 1:x scaling (x different from 1) later... </p>";
